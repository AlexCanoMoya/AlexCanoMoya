Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Alex. I'm an Electronics Engineer (2017) that felt in love with AI/ML/DL field, new techs and modern development so I changed my lovely hardware and my embeded systems coding for a good PC and many hours of code writing.
I got a Master Degree in AI (2022) and I'm searching for new professional challenges in this area.

I'm also an amateur music producer and I love playing guitar and drums!

This git will be used to store my personal ideas portfolio to keep on my training. Feel free to check it!

And as the template says...
